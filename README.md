# L20-Edu-135M

An auditable single-GPU study of data-efficient 135M language-model training.
The project trains a Llama-style decoder model from scratch, continues it on a
strictly filtered Stage 4 mixture, evaluates public baselines under the same
`lm-eval` harness, and records a small-model RLVR negative result.

Latest controlled experiment: the
[FineWeb-Edu 1B schedule pair](results/fineweb_1b/README.md) completed on one
RTX 4090 per 141.6M-wide run. WSD lowered endpoint validation perplexity by
6.56% in one seed; the two 134.5M deep-thin runs OOMed, so the four-cell
factorial remains incomplete. No downstream gain is established. Its corrected
dense-BF16 MFU estimate is about 45.1%, not the archived 90.2% computed with
the smaller, non-BF16-Tensor denominator.

Follow-up: [memory-matched recovery probes](results/fineweb_recovery/README.md)
passed three real optimizer updates on both architectures with microbatch 2
and accumulation 39. The three-seed full matrix is configured but not launched;
storage safety remains a gate. This does not change the historical quality result.

## Why This Repo Exists

Most public small-language-model releases hide the parts that matter for
reproducibility: exact token budgets, filtering gates, continuation decisions,
failed post-training experiments, and compute constraints. This repository keeps
those pieces visible.

The central result is not a state-of-the-art claim. It is a controlled,
single-NVIDIA-L20 training record showing how far a 135M model can be pushed
with about 13B total tokens, careful data filtering, conservative SFT
interpolation, and honest evaluation against larger-budget public baselines.

## Headline Result

| Model | Params | Public/prepared tokens | Hardware | 6-task mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: |
| L20-Edu-135M | 134.5M | ~13B | 1x L20 | 0.4150 |
| SmolLM-135M | 135M | 600B | 64x H100 | 0.4767 |
| SmolLM2-135M | 135M | 2T | 64x H100 | 0.4917 |
| Qwen2.5-0.5B | 494M | public | public | 0.5363 |
| OLMo-1B | 1B | public | public | 0.5681 |

The L20-Edu checkpoint reaches about 87.1% of the self-run SmolLM-135M six-task
mean with about 2.17% of its reported token budget. The same comparison against
SmolLM2-135M is about 84.4% of the mean with about 0.65% of the token budget.

The six-task suite is ARC-Challenge, ARC-Easy, HellaSwag, LAMBADA OpenAI, PIQA,
and WinoGrande. Baseline numbers are self-run with the same harness protocol
where possible, not copied from leaderboards.

## Evidence Map

| Claim | Committed evidence | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Six-task model comparison | [`results/benchmark_comparison.json`](results/benchmark_comparison.json) | Curated aggregate plus task rows |
| Selected Stage 4 checkpoint | [`results/stage4/final_model.json`](results/stage4/final_model.json) | Release decision record |
| Stage 4 data gate | [`results/stage4/data_gate.json`](results/stage4/data_gate.json) | Recorded filtering output, not raw corpus custody |
| SFT selection | [`results/stage4/sft_regression_gate.json`](results/stage4/sft_regression_gate.json) | Regression-gated interpolation decision |
| RLVR negative result | [`results/rlvr/gsm8k_c320_decision.json`](results/rlvr/gsm8k_c320_decision.json) | GSM8K experiment at this model scale |
| FineWeb-Edu 1B schedule ablation | [`results/fineweb_1b/factorial_20260906.json`](results/fineweb_1b/factorial_20260906.json) | Two completed 141.6M-wide cells plus two preserved 134.5M OOM cells |
| Environment and artifact manifest | [`docs/reproducibility.md`](docs/reproducibility.md) | Reproduction inputs and known gaps |

The committed summaries make the release auditable, but they are not substitutes
for raw data custody, model checkpoints, or an independent rerun. Those larger
artifacts remain outside Git and are called out explicitly in the reports.

## Final Selected Checkpoint

The selected public checkpoint is the Stage 4 SFT interpolation candidate
`stage4-sft-a0875`: 87.5% anti-forgetting SFT interpolation and 12.5% Stage 4
base interpolation. This was selected because it gave the best aggregate score
without clear regression on the base benchmark suite.

| Task | Metric | Score |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| ARC-Challenge | acc_norm | 0.2867 |
| ARC-Easy | acc_norm | 0.4958 |
| HellaSwag | acc_norm | 0.3240 |
| LAMBADA OpenAI | acc | 0.2602 |
| PIQA | acc_norm | 0.6148 |
| WinoGrande | acc | 0.5083 |
| Mean | - | 0.4150 |

## Data And Contamination Controls

Stage 4 added 3,000,000,965 curated continuation tokens after the initial 10B
FineWeb-Edu run. The filtering gate included:

- cross-source 64-permutation MinHash plus LSH near-deduplication;
- sentence/template and repeated-paragraph filtering;
- benchmark 13-gram contamination screening;
- LCS overlap removal at ratio `>= 0.60`;
- per-source epoch caps to avoid overtraining narrow sources;
- restricted MixtureVita usage focused on structured tutorial, FAQ, and
  reasoning-like content because the source card does not claim complete
  cross-source deduplication.

The recorded gate indexed 3,312,229 documents, checked 34,852,069 segments,
created 52,995,632 LSH bands, and removed 23 benchmark-overlap candidates.

## Post-Training Findings

SFT helped slightly only when mixed back with the base checkpoint. Full SFT did
not dominate the base model on the six-task suite, so the release keeps the
interpolation result rather than overstating instruction-tuning gains.

RLVR on GSM8K was negative at this scale. The best recorded base score was
24/1319 exact matches, while RLVR variants decreased exact-match accuracy. The
repo includes this result because it is useful evidence for the question of
whether verifiable-reward reasoning emerges in a 135M model.

Large artifacts are intentionally not committed: checkpoints, raw datasets,
raw `lm-eval` sample dumps, run directories, logs, Hugging Face tokens, and
machine-local environment directories stay outside Git.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Install the PyTorch build that matches your CUDA runtime before training on a
GPU host.

## Reproduce Key Checks

Run repository hygiene checks:

```bash
python scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py
```

Fail fast on invalid attention shapes, schedules, token budgets, or disabled
interval settings before allocating GPU time:

```bash
python scripts/check_pretrain_configs.py

# Validate selected files and print their derived token budgets.
python -m l20_pretrain.config \
  configs/smoke.yaml \
  configs/l20_edu_135m_stage4_hq_crossdedup_8k.yaml
```

Formal loss evaluation never falls back to training data. Tokenized runs must
provide a distinct `val.bin`; streaming or raw-text runs must define a separate
top-level `eval_dataset`. Configs without independent validation keep
`trainer.eval_interval: 0`.

Exact `--resume` is supported for immutable tokenized shards with
`trainer.num_workers: 0`. Checkpoints save the consumed block offset plus
Python, NumPy, CPU, and CUDA RNG state. Streaming/raw-text continuation must use
`init_model_name_or_path`; it is intentionally rejected as an exact resume.

Newly prepared packed shards include byte counts and SHA256 digests for
`train.bin` and `val.bin`. Verify them before allocating a run:

```bash
python scripts/verify_shard_manifest.py data/my_packed_shards
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Run the six-task harness for a local checkpoint:

```bash
scripts/eval_lm_harness.sh runs/l20-edu-135m-stage4-selected
```

Run public baselines and compare:

```bash
scripts/eval_public_baselines.sh
python scripts/compare_lm_eval.py \
  --candidate l20-edu-135m=eval_results/l20-edu-135m \
  --baseline smollm-135m=eval_results/smollm-135m \
  --baseline smollm2-135m=eval_results/smollm2-135m
```

Run the GSM8K exact-match summarizer:

```bash
python scripts/eval_gsm8k_exact.py --help
python scripts/summarize_rlvr_gsm8k_results.py --help
```

## Release Discipline

The project is deliberately conservative:

- claims are tied to committed result summaries and report tables;
- raw samples and benchmark dumps are excluded from Git;
- negative RLVR and SFT ablation outcomes are preserved;
- token-budget comparisons are separated from quality claims;
- no no-contamination claim is made beyond the documented filters.
